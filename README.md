TechnicalTest
The solution comprises two projects
Calulator (spelling) contains the solution logic, there is an interface used to define the reference data, it has two interefaces in production these would be separated and the interfaces themselves might be defined in a different assembly. There is also an enum defined containing completion statuses, again in production these might be setup for use as a bitmap to support multiple error statuses for a given calculation
UnitTest a set of unit tests for the code, the test is parameterised though as included there are very scenarios, this will definitely require additional effort.
